# Goal

- Reduce the number of severe collisions in the US and specifically in Seattle. 
- Help insurance companies by accurately predicting insurance rates using this model, whereby indirectly minimizing the risk of severe collisions. 
- Other applications could involve *rideshare* or *mapping apps*. 

# Approach 

- Use machine learning to predict severe collisions and explore important factors.

1. **Data**: Consists of a text file which contains a link to the dataset as the data itself was too large to directly include in Github. The text file is called *Link_to_dataset.txt*.

2. **Images**: Contains some of the images used in the presentation slides for this project. 

3. **Notebooks**: Contains the Python Jupyter Notebooks used for cleaning, analysis and modeling. More details regarding the notebooks are in the directory itself.  

4. **Reports**: Contains all the documentation for the project including a detailed report and presentation slides.
