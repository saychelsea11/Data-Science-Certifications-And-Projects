#### This is my (Sayan Das) data science repository containing numerous projects across a wide range of data science topics. You can either explore the hierarchy of certifications and individual projects in chronological order or just skip to the most recent projects within the directory.  

#### The contents are split into 5 specializations and a few individual projects. Each specialization also has projects within. Here is a breakdown of each category in chronological order: 

# Certifications/Specializations

1. **Springboard Data Science Bootcamp**: Data science bootcamp covering 600+ hours of curriculum, assignments and projects. Contains 2 capstone projects involving practical business problems using real-world data. 

   a. [Capstone 1:] (https://github.com/saychelsea11/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Springboard%20Data%20Science%20Bootcamp/Capstone1%20Project)
   b. Capstone 2: https://github.com/saychelsea11/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Springboard%20Data%20Science%20Bootcamp/Capstone2%20Project

2. **IBM Data Science Professional Ceritificate**: Data science certification covering a broad range of topics and skills spanning 9 courses and a capstone project. Covers the entire data science workflow with special emphasis on each aspect such as business problem formulation, data cleaning, data exploration and modeling. 

3. **Applied Data Science With Python**: Intensive data science certification with a heavy focus on Python and the Pandas library. Covers 5 courses (data wrangling, data visualization, text mining, machine learning, network analysis) with in-depth assignment and mini-projects culminating in a capstone project at the end. 

4. **Statistics With R Specialization**: Certification in R with a heavy emphasis on statistics. Covered 3 courses (data analysis, statistical inference, linear regression) in great detail and provided a solid understanding of statistics and R. Completed a project for each course. 

5. **Python For Everybody Specialization**: Introductory Python certification consisting of 5 courses covering topics such as data structures, conditional statements, iteration, APIs, SQL, web crawling etc. 

# Individual Projects

1. **Analyzing Asian Enrollment at Harvard Univerisity**: Invidual project exploring Harvard's admissions process following the recent controvery regarding the enrollment of Asian students at the school.

2. **Predicting Housing Prices In Ames, Iowa (Kaggle)**: Linear regression problem to predict housing prices given various features of houses in Ames, Iowa. The main evaluation metric was log mean squared error. 

3. **Cuisine Prediction (Kaggle)**: Predicting cuisines from a dataset of ingredients. Each row of the dataset contained the ingredients as text data and the cuisine as the target variable to be predicted.
