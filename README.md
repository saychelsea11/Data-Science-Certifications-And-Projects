### This is my (Sayan Das) data science repository containing numerous projects across a wide range of data science topics. The contents are split into specific specializations and categories. There are 4 specializations and a few individual projects. Here is a breakdown: 

# Certifications/Specializations

1. **Springboard Data Science Track**: Data science bootcamp covering 600+ hours of curriculum, assignments and projects. Contains 2 capstone projects involving practical business problems using real-world data. 

2. **IBM Data Science Professional Ceritificate**: Data science certification covering a broad range of topics and skills spanning 9 courses and a capstone project. Covers the entire data science workflow with special emphasis on each aspect such as business problem formulation, data cleaning, data exploration and modeling. 

3. **Applied Data Science With Python**: Intensive data science certification with a heavy focus on Python and the Pandas library. Covers 5 courses (data wrangling, data visualization, text mining, machine learning, network analysis) with in-depth assignment and mini-projects culminating in a capstone project at the end. 

4. **Statistics With R Specialization**: Certification in R with a heavy emphasis on statistics. Covered 3 courses (data analysis, statistical inference, linear regression) in great detail and provided a solid understanding of statistics and R. Completed a project for each course. 

5. **Python For Everybody Specialization**: Introductory Python certification consisting of 5 courses covering topics such as data structures, conditional statements, iteration, APIs, SQL, web crawling etc. 

# Individual Projects:

1. **Predicting Housing Prices In Ames, Iowa (Kaggle)**: Linear regression problem to predict housing prices given various features of houses in Ames, Iowa. The main evaluation metric was log mean squared error. 

2. **Cuisine Prediction (Kaggle)**: Predicting cuisines from a dataset of ingredients. Each row of the dataset contained the ingredients as text data and the cuisine as the target variable to be predicted. 

3. **Analyzing Asian Enrollment at Harvard Univerisity**: Invidual project exploring Harvard's admissions process following the recent controvery regarding the enrollment of Asian students at the school.
