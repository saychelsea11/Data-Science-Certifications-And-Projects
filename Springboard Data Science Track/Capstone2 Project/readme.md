### Data: Consists of 2 files:

1. **topics_keeps_vs_coherence.csv**: CSV file which contains a table for comparing LDA coherence scores across model parameters. 
2. **dataset_link.txt**: Text file which contains a link to the dataset. Since the complete dataset is over 400MB, it could not be added to Github as the limit is 100MB. 

### Notebooks: There are a total of 6 Python Jupyter Notebooks used for cleaning, EDA and modeling. 

### Reports: Contains 2 main reports: 

1. **Capstone2_Final_Report**: Detailed final report covering the goal of the project, the business problem, cleaning techniques, EDA and modeling. 
2. **Stack_Exchange_Topic_Modeling_Presentation**: Concise report in the form of slides. Provides a good overview of the project.
