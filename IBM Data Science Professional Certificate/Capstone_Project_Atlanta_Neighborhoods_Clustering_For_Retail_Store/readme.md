# Goal

- To determine which one of the 161 neighborhoods in Atlanta is the best location for opening a retail store. 
- To find the best possible location to attract crowds. 
- Analyze each neighborhood based on the quantity and types of venues present in each that could complement a retail store. For example, having coffee shops in close proximity could attract customers to the retail store. 
- Audience would include different types of retail stores such as clothing stores, shoe stores, etc., as well as the owners and market researchers for these companies. 

# Approach 

- Used clustering to group together neighborhoods which have similar vanues and population sizes. 
- Extracted neighborhoods using Python's *geocoder* library.
- Used the Foursquare API to extract venues for each neighborhood.
